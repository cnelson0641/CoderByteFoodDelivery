# CBFD Developer Guide

## Design Decisions
The app is a Maven Java project, which takes care of dependency management and building for you.  The .jar can be run by itself, but is packaged easily inside a Java Docker image for easy deployment.

## Future Work
- Add deeper unit tests for coverage
- Add DB support, for both a locally deployed db and a cloud deployed one
- Add integration tests for interacting with the DB
- Add more restaurants to choose from.
